  ### Project Overview

  
This data analysis is to test the following hypotheses
- H1: Impact of the Ukraine war on the stock prices in the manufacturing sector.
- H2: The Ukraine war negatively impacts clothes manufacturing companies other than other manufacturing companies.
- H3: The Ukraine war negatively impacts small manufacturing companies more than large manufacturing companies.

### Data sources
Secondary data was used for the analysis sourced from Wharton  Research DATA Services.

### Tools 
- Market model modelling tool CRSP Wrds and SPSS.
- SPSS: Files generated from  the CRSP  were migrated into SPSS (To merge variables, to produce a multiple regression model).

### Data cleaning
The data was identified for the analysis.

### Exploratory of Data Analysis

### Data Analysis
- SPSS was used for analysis, Wrdsapps (Wharton  Research DATA Services) and CRSP (Centre for Research in Security Prices).
- The risk model used is the market model. The 10 days before the event date and 10 days after the event days. The analysis used the default setting; the PERMNO identifier was selected. The event date of 24-02-2022 was used.
 100 days estimation window days, with 70 as observations. The 50-day Gap is the number of trading days established set up between the end of the estimation window and the beginning of the window.

- Intergroup Comparison and Multiple Regression 
Intergroup comparison was used to test the H2 and H3 hypotheses.  I Chose date range 2022-01 to 2022 â€“ 12. Apply company codes, and upload the LPERMNO file. Variable in screen to be left as default. Selected SIC AND EMP.

#### Results

The hypotheses results:

Table 1 was realised to determine whether to accept or reject H1. Using P value <0.05 as a threshold.
H1: Impact of the Ukraine war on the stock prices in the manufacturing sector., whether there was a significant decrease, increase or no significant change.
The result of the event chart in the appendices shows a positive impact on manufacturing.
The total return day is 31 days which is 10 days before and 10 days after. (CAR)= 0.0668546.
Abnormal return is for each day. The stats are used for the academic report to test the difference in results from H1. The result should be between 0 and 1 Probability, cross-sectional for Abnormal Return. The smaller the value, the result is more significant.

The higher the T value, the more significant. 
The chart result (See Figure 7) reads that the result is over the 0% horizontal line over the period. -10 days before is 0.97%, 0 days is 2.63% and 10 days after is 6.99%. It is positive you accept the H1 hypothesis because the line is over the 0% horizontal line based on the confidence level; it's significant.
Mean Cumulative Total Return (At the end of Event Window) = -0.0412087382755894.
Mean Cumulative Abnormal Return (At the end of Event Window) = 0.0599943229759936.

The result of day 10 is not significant (<.353511), and 4 days before the event are not significant (0.165127). The result of 0 days is used to determine the result, which is significant at 0.00014; it is less than 0.05.



### Limitations 

Model 1- 3 results show differences in the number of companies. The results achieved in this research contained a 10-day event window from 14th February 2022 to 7th March 2022. Longer days are suggested for the study against the 10 days that have been applied. It is helpful for short-term investors. The effect of long and short periods can be assessed for future studies. Other areas in the manufacturing sector can be looked into, like food manufacturing, aside from the clothing companies. The research is limited to companies listed in the U.S. stock market. For future studies, the long-term effect of the current Ukraine war on the global supply chain could be examined (Maurya Prince et al., 2023).
